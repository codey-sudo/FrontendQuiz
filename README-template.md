## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Select a quiz subject
- Select a single answer from each question from a choice of four
- See an error message when trying to submit an answer without making a selection
- See if they have made a correct or incorrect choice when they submit an answer
- Move on to the next question after seeing the question result
- See a completed state with the score after the final question
- Play again to choose another subject
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the entire app only using their keyboard
- **Bonus**: Change the app's theme between light and dark

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

- How to make a single page application using JSON?
- Something different: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs)
- All the avenues and directions I considered during the planning phase, like single page, framework application vs. Vanilla javascript
- Figjam used for task flows, flowcharts
- Modular approach to fullstack design
- ChatGPT for help with planning out the logic of system

### Just Drafts for a plan of attack

- Think about the transitions from one section to the rest.


Mapping out the core logic of your application can be facilitated by various tools that help you plan, visualize, and document your code. Here are some programmer's tools that can be useful for mapping out core logic:

Flowcharts:

Tools: Draw.io, Lucidchart, Microsoft Visio
Use Case: Flowcharts are great for visualizing the flow of your program, including decision points, loops, and the sequence of operations.
Mind Maps:

Tools: XMind, MindMeister, FreeMind
Use Case: Mind maps can help you brainstorm and organize ideas, making them useful for high-level planning and breaking down complex problems.
UML Diagrams:

Tools: Visual Paradigm, draw.io, PlantUML
Use Case: Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams, such as class diagrams and sequence diagrams, can help you represent the structure and interactions in your software.
Pseudocode:

Tools: Any text editor or collaborative writing tool
Use Case: Write pseudocode, which is a high-level description of your program's logic using plain language, to plan and structure your code before implementation.

Finish Creately diagram with putting pseudocode side by side with flow-chart task flows.

### Built with

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
